# 🔄 Rojo Sync Status

## Current Status: ❌ Rojo Not Installed

Your code is **perfectly ready** to sync with Rojo, but Rojo itself needs to be installed first.

## ✅ What's Already Set Up Correctly

### 1. **Perfect rojo.toml Configuration**

```toml
name = "spectacular-roblox-obby"
servePort = 34872

[tree]
ReplicatedStorage = "src/ReplicatedStorage"
ServerScriptService = "src/ServerScriptService"
StarterPlayer = "src/StarterPlayer"
```

### 2. **Correct Project Structure**

```text
src/
├── ReplicatedStorage/
│   └── ObbyConfig.lua ✅
├── ServerScriptService/
│   ├── ObbyManager.lua ✅
│   ├── ObbyStages.lua ✅
│   └── ObbySetup.lua ✅
└── StarterPlayer/
    └── StarterPlayerScripts/
        └── ObbyClient.lua ✅
```

## 🚀 Quick Install Options

### Option 1: Install Rojo (Recommended for Development)

#### Method A: Using Foreman (Easiest)

1. Download [Foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman/releases)
2. Add to your PATH
3. Run: `foreman install`

#### Method B: Direct Download

1. Get latest [Rojo release](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases)
2. Download `rojo.exe` for Windows
3. Add to PATH or place in project folder

#### Method C: Cargo (if you have Rust)

```bash
cargo install rojo
```

### Option 2: Manual Copy (Works Great Too!)

Just copy your scripts to Roblox Studio manually:

1. Open Roblox Studio
2. Copy each `.lua` file to its respective folder
3. Press F5 to test

## 🎮 Once Rojo is Installed

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd c:\git\roblox\roblox

# Start Rojo server
rojo serve

# In Roblox Studio:
# 1. Install Rojo plugin
# 2. Connect to localhost:34872
# 3. Your changes sync automatically!
```

## 💡 Pro Tip

Your obby is **100% ready to test** even without Rojo! The manual copy method works perfectly for getting started. Rojo just makes development faster by auto-syncing changes.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Quick Test**: Copy scripts manually to Studio and press F5
2. **Development Setup**: Install Rojo for auto-sync workflow
3. **Enjoy**: Watch your spectacular obby come to life! 🎪

Your code structure is perfect - you just need to choose your preferred sync method!
